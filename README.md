The music maker theme we are going for is a cutesy Halloween ghost choir. We have gathered inspiration from the ghost choirs that already exist on youtube, we wanted to do that but make it a fun interactive experience. The demographic is E for everyone but mostly aimed for younger audiences due to the cutesy style. 
The ghosts can either be played all together or individually with buttons to control more specific things like muting or pausing etc.  

The SVGS all have little animations that play when dragged to the interactive area.
